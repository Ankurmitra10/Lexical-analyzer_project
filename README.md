# Lexical Analyzer in C

This project is a simple lexical analyzer implemented in C. It reads multi-line C source code and breaks it down into tokens such as keywords, identifiers, numbers, strings, symbols, and operators. The program also tracks the line number of each token.

## Features

- Identifies:
  - Keywords (`int`, `char`, `if`, etc.)
  - Identifiers (e.g., variable names)
  - Numbers (integers)
  - Strings (inside double quotes)
